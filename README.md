    client_max_body_size  200M;

    listen       80; ## listen for ipv4
    #listen       [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6

    server_name  yii2-angular-seed.com;
    root         /var/www/yii2-angular-seed;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/yii2-angular-seed.com-access.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/yii2-angular-seed.com-error.log;

    location / {
        root  /var/www/yii2-angular-seed/apps;
        rewrite ^/?(.*) /apps/index.html last;
    }

    location /app/ {
        alias /var/www/yii2-angular-seed/apps/app/;
    }

    location /vendor/ {
        alias /var/www/yii2-angular-seed/vendor/;
    }

    location /api {
        alias  /var/www/yii2-angular-seed/frontend/web;

        rewrite  ^(/api)/$ $1 permanent;
        try_files  $uri /frontend/web/index.php?$args;
    }

    # avoiding processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    location ~ ^/api/(.+\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar))$ {
        access_log  off;
        expires  360d;

        rewrite  ^/api/(.+)$ /frontend/web/$1 break;
        rewrite  ^/api/(.+)/(.+)$ /frontend/web/$1/$2 break;
        try_files  $uri =404;
    }

    location /admin {
        alias  /var/www/yii2-angular-seed/backend/web;

        rewrite  ^(/admin)/$ $1 permanent;
        try_files  $uri /backend/web/index.php?$args;
    }

    # avoiding processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    location ~ ^/admin/(.+\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar))$ {
        access_log  off;
        expires  360d;

        rewrite  ^/admin/(.+)$ /backend/web/$1 break;
        rewrite  ^/admin/(.+)/(.+)$ /backend/web/$1/$2 break;
        try_files  $uri =404;
    }

    location ~ \.(php|htm|html)$ {
        include  fastcgi_params;
        # check your /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf to see if PHP-FPM is listening on a socket or port
        fastcgi_pass  unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock; ## listen for socket
        #fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000; ## listen for port
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        try_files  $uri =404;
    }
    #error_page  404 /404.html;

    location = /requirements.php {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.(ht|svn|git) {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

If you cannot access html files, you need to add to the /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf inside the [www] section

```sh
security.limit_extensions = .php .html
```
